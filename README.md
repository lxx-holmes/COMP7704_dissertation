## 📘 Overview

This dissertation introduces **Value Investing Agents (VIA)** — a **multi-agent, multimodal LLM framework** designed to perform *Buffett-style* financial statement analysis and value investing.  
The system simulates a team of specialized AI analysts who collectively analyze company fundamentals, generate insights, and backtest long-term investment strategies.

> Traditional value investing requires deep reasoning across large volumes of data and qualitative reports.  
> VIA automates this process using **agentic collaboration**, **self-critique loops**, and **cross-source verification**, achieving higher analytical accuracy and depth compared to baselines like *Manus* and *OpenAI Deep Research*.

## 🧩 Framework Architecture

VIA is composed of four coordinated AI teams:

</p>
*Overall VIA architecture*

1. **Data Specialists Team** – Extracts and verifies 10-K filings and market data using multimodal models.  
   *(Figure 4: Data verification pipeline)*

2. **Industry Research Team** – Summarizes sector benchmarks and competitive positioning.  
   *(Table 1: Example output for Tech and Energy sectors)*

3. **Analyst Team** – Junior and senior analysts collaborate to analyze company fundamentals over multiple years using five dimensions:
   - Business Strategy  
   - Income Statement Quality  
   - Balance Sheet Quality  
   - Cash Flow Quality  
   - Ratio Analysis  
   *(Figures 5–12: Analytical frameworks and workflows)*

4. **Valuation & Trading Team** – Performs intrinsic valuation (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S) and trading backtests.  
   *(Figures 17-1 & 17-2: Example valuation reports for Apple Inc.)*

## ⚙️ Methodology

### Agent Collaboration
Agents communicate through **natural language reasoning** and use structured **tool calls** for:
- Web and API searches for live financial data  
- OCR and vision models for parsing tables and charts  
- Quantitative analysis for financial ratios and valuation  

### Self-Critique and Refinement
Each report undergoes iterative **LLM self-review** for:
- **Quantitative accuracy** (data consistency)  
- **Qualitative coherence** (reasoning and narrative flow)  

*(Figures 14-1, 14-2: Example of self-refinement process)*

### Models Used
- **Doubao-Vision-Pro-32k** — multimodal data extraction  
- **DeepSeek-R1** — reasoning and self-critique  
- **ChatGPT-4o** — cross-domain industry insights  
- **Tavily Search Agent** — real-time data retrieval

## 📊 Dataset

- 100 U.S. listed companies across **11 industries**  
- 10 years of 10-K filings per company  
- Average token length per document: ~123k  
- Enables long-context reasoning and document understanding research  

*(Figures 1 & 2: Industry coverage and token distribution)*

## 🔍 Evaluation

### Baseline Comparisons
| Model | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Manus** | Structured summaries | Shallow reasoning depth |
| **OpenAI Deep Research** | Strong narrative | Low factual consistency |
| **VIA** | Accurate, coherent, verifiable | Higher compute cost |

*(Figures 18–22: Side-by-side comparison with baseline systems)*

### Trading Performance
- Initial capital: \$1,000,000  
- Duration: 2020–2025  
- Outperformed Buy-and-Hold, MACD, and Mean-Reversion strategies  
- Generated **positive alpha** with realistic risk-adjusted returns  

*(Figures 20–22: Portfolio backtest and P&L visualization)*
