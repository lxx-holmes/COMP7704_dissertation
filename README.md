## 📘 Overview

This dissertation introduces **Value Investing Agents (VIA)** — a **multi-agent, multimodal LLM framework** designed to perform *Buffett-style* financial statement analysis and value investing.  
The system simulates a team of specialized AI analysts who collectively analyze company fundamentals, generate insights, and backtest long-term investment strategies.

> Traditional value investing requires deep reasoning across large volumes of data and qualitative reports.  
> VIA automates this process using **agentic collaboration**, **self-critique loops**, and **cross-source verification**, achieving higher analytical accuracy and depth compared to baselines like *Manus* and *OpenAI Deep Research*.

## 🧩 Framework Architecture

VIA is composed of four coordinated AI teams:

1. **Data Specialists Team** – Extracts and verifies 10-K filings and market data using multimodal models.

2. **Industry Research Team** – Summarizes sector benchmarks and competitive positioning.  
  
Samples of the industry expert’s output on industrial insights

| Sector | Subsector | Metrics |
|:--------|:-----------|:---------|
| **Technology** | Consumer Electronics | "Unit sales growth", "ASP trends", "Product lifecycle metrics", "Margin by product line", "Innovation pipeline value" |
| **Energy** | Oil & Gas Integrated | "Reserve replacement ratio", "Production growth", "Refining margins", "Break-even oil price", "Carbon intensity metrics" |
  

3. **Analyst Team** – Junior and senior analysts collaborate to analyze company fundamentals over multiple years using five dimensions:
   - Business Strategy  
   - Income Statement Quality  
   - Balance Sheet Quality  
   - Cash Flow Quality  
   - Ratio Analysis  
   *(Figures 5–12: Analytical frameworks and workflows)*

4. **Valuation & Trading Team** – Performs intrinsic valuation (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S) and trading backtests.

> ### Valuation Analysis  
> Apple’s stock continued to climb in 2023, reaching about $175/share in early November despite FY2023 seeing a small revenue and profit dip (the first annual sales decline since 2019). This pushed Apple’s trailing P/E to roughly 27–28×. Investors treated Apple as a safe haven tech stock – it traded at a 35% P/E premium over the S&P 500 and ~22% over median tech peers by late 2023. The valuation implied confidence that Apple’s ecosystem momentum would offset the temporary hardware slump.  
> 
> Our intrinsic valuation balances Apple’s strong moat with the reality of flat-to-declining FY2023 earnings:
> 
> • **P/E:** We apply **25×** to FY2023 EPS (**$6.15**), a slight contraction from the market’s 27–28×, to reflect the growth slowdown. This gives an intrinsic value of roughly **$155/share**. The 25× multiple is still above the market’s long-term average, but reasonable given Apple’s superior ROIC (~39% vs ~14% sector) and anticipation of new product cycles (e.g., Vision Pro AR headset).  
> 
> • **EV/EBITDA:** Apple’s EV/EBITDA around this time was in the low-20s. We choose ~**18×** for intrinsic value, yielding a similar **$150–$160** range. Notably, Apple’s EV/EBITDA was about a 12% discount to Microsoft’s in 2023 (Apple ~19× vs MSFT ~22×) but well above Meta’s 12×, reflecting Apple’s steadier profile.  
> 
> • **P/S:** Around **7× sales** (with ~$383 B revenue), Apple’s P/S remained between hardware and software norms. Given stable margins, this again points to a value in the mid-$150s (since 5× would be too low and 10× too high for Apple’s mix).  
> 
> ---
> **DDM Check:** Dividend ≈ $0.95 (yield 0.55%). Even with an optimistic growth outlook, the DDM value ($45–$50) is only a fraction of the stock price – a reminder that investors in 2023 were focused on Apple’s total cash return (dividends + big buybacks) and future growth, not just the dividend stream. Apple returned an enormous ~$90 B via buybacks in FY2023, shrinking share count ~4% and buoying EPS despite flat net income.  
> 
> Our intrinsic value estimate for late 2023 is about **$160/share**. The stock at $175+ appeared somewhat overvalued (~10% above intrinsic). The market’s optimism (Apple +28% YTD vs +18% Nasdaq by Nov 2023) was “pricing in” perfect execution of Apple’s next moves (continued services growth and a successful Vision Pro launch). Any hiccup in those expectations meant the intrinsic value would lag the market price.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### Agent Collaboration
Agents communicate through **natural language reasoning** and use structured **tool calls** for:
- Web and API searches for live financial data  
- OCR and vision models for parsing tables and charts  
- Quantitative analysis for financial ratios and valuation  

### Self-Critique and Refinement
Each report undergoes iterative **LLM self-review** for:
- **Quantitative accuracy** (data consistency)  
- **Qualitative coherence** (reasoning and narrative flow)  

*(Figures 14-1, 14-2: Example of self-refinement process)*

### Models Used
- **Doubao-Vision-Pro-32k** — multimodal data extraction  
- **DeepSeek-R1** — reasoning and self-critique  
- **ChatGPT-4o** — cross-domain industry insights  
- **Tavily Search Agent** — real-time data retrieval
